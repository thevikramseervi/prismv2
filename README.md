## 🎯 Business Logic

### Attendance Rules
- **Full Day (Present)**: ≥8 hours 30 minutes worked
- **Half Day**: ≥3 hours 45 minutes and <8 hours 30 minutes worked
- **Absent (LOP)**: <3 hours 45 minutes worked
- **Weekends**: Saturday & Sunday (automatically marked)
- **Holidays**: Company holidays (configurable)
- **Casual Leave**: Approved leave applications

### Salary Calculation
```
Total Days     = Days in the month (from joining date if mid-month joiner)
Weekend Days   = Saturday & Sunday within Total Days (holiday takes priority over weekend)
Holiday Days   = Company holidays within Total Days (counted first; not double-counted as weekend)
Present Days   = Full days (≥8h30m) from biometric/manual attendance
Half Days      = Half days (≥3h45m, <8h30m) from attendance
Casual Leave   = Approved leave days (excl. weekends & holidays)
LOP Days       = Unrecorded weekdays (no attendance and no leave)

Total Pay Days = Present Days + (Half Days × 0.5) + Casual Leave + Weekend Days + Holiday Days
Net Salary     = (Total Pay Days / Total Days) × Base Salary
```

### Leave Management
- **Total Annual Leave**: 12 days per employee
- **Leave Types**: Casual Leave only (no half-day leaves)
- **Approval Required**: Lab Admin or Super Admin
- **Balance Tracking**: Available, Used, and Pending leaves
- **Overlapping Prevention**: System checks for conflicting dates

### Leave Report  
- All leave applications with status
- Summary: Pending, Approved, Rejected, Cancelled
- Export to Excel

### Payroll Report
- Filter by month, year, and employee
- Summary: Total gross, net salary, payment status
- Detailed breakdown by employee
- Export to Excel

## 🔄 Biometric Integration

### How It Works
1. Biometric device captures employee in/out times
2. Data is stored in `biometric_logs` table
3. Admin triggers manual sync or scheduled job runs
4. System processes logs:
   - Calculates total duration per day
   - Determines attendance status based on hours
   - Creates/updates attendance records
   - Marks logs as processed

### Manual Sync
- Navigate to **Admin Panel**
- Select date to sync
- Click "Sync Biometric Data"
- System processes all unprocessed logs for that date

## 💼 Payroll Generation

### Steps
1. Navigate to **Admin Panel**
2. Select Month/Year
3. Choose employee (or select "All Employees" for bulk generation)
4. Optionally set a **Pay Date** (defaults to last day of the month)
5. Click "Generate Payroll"
6. System calculates per employee:
   - Total days (respects mid-month joining date)
   - Weekend days and holiday days
   - Attendance from biometric/manual records
   - Casual leave from approved applications
   - Loss of Pay for unrecorded weekdays
   - Net salary using the formula above
7. Generates salary slips — downloadable as PDF or Excel from "Salary Slips" page
8. Slips start as **DRAFT**; Super Admin can mark them **PAID** via the Reports page

### Salary Slip Features
- Professional PDF format
- Excel format with formulas
- Includes: Employee details, attendance summary, salary breakdown
- Downloadable from "Salary Slips" page

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Landing Page** - Public landing with sign-in; app when authenticated
- **Theme** - Light/dark mode toggle (persisted)
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop, tablet, mobile
- **Material Design** - Modern, consistent UI (MUI v7)
- **Role-Based Navigation** - Menu items based on user role
- **Loading States** - Smooth loading indicators
- **Error Handling** - User-friendly error messages
- **Success Notifications** - Snackbar alerts
- **Data Grid** - Sortable, paginated tables
- **Form Validation** - Real-time validation
- **Protected Routes** - Automatic redirection
- **Change Password** - In-app change password (user menu)

## 🔒 Security

- JWT token-based authentication
- Optional TOTP two-factor authentication for admins (LAB_ADMIN, SUPER_ADMIN)
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Password reset via time-limited email links
- Role-based access control on all sensitive endpoints
- Ownership checks: employees can only access their own payslips, attendance, and leave records
- In-memory rate limiting on login / password-reset to prevent brute force
- Email normalised to lowercase on creation and lookup (case-insensitive auth)
- HTTP security headers via `helmet` middleware
- Swagger API docs disabled in production (`NODE_ENV=production`)
- SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- CORS configuration

## 📥 Data Migration

The system includes scripts to import historical data from Excel files.

### Quick Start

1. **Create sample Excel templates:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run migrate:create-samples
   ```

2. **Prepare your data** using the sample templates in `backend/data/`

3. **Import data:**
   ```bash
   # Import all data at once
   npm run migrate:all
   
   # Or import individually
   npm run migrate:users data/employees.xlsx
   npm run migrate:attendance data/attendance.xlsx
   npm run migrate:biometric data/biometric.xlsx
   ```

### Migration Scripts

- `npm run migrate:create-samples` - Create sample Excel templates
- `npm run migrate:users <file>` - Import employees/users
- `npm run migrate:attendance <file>` - Import attendance records
- `npm run migrate:biometric <file>` - Import biometric logs
- `npm run migrate:all` - Import all data from data/ directory

See [DATA_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](backend/DATA_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

## 📝 Notes

- Base salary for all employees: ₹22,000
- Casual leave quota: 12 days per year; pro-rata for mid-year joiners using the **15th-day rule**: joining on or before the 15th counts that month; joining after the 15th skips it (e.g. joining April 10 → 9 days; joining April 20 → 8 days)
- Payroll for mid-month joiners: days before the joining date are excluded from all calculations (not counted as weekend, holiday, or LOP)
- No half-day casual leave
- Weekends: Saturday & Sunday
- Working hours: 8 hours 30 minutes = full day

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
- Check PostgreSQL is running
- Verify DATABASE_URL in .env
- Run `npm run prisma:generate`

### Frontend won't start
- Check backend is running on port 3000
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Clear node_modules and reinstall

### Can't login
- Use default credentials: admin@cambridge.edu.in / admin123
- Check backend console for errors
- Verify JWT_SECRET is set
